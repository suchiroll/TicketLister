## To Run

## Part 3: 

- The filter in part 2 could be further refined by providing different location filters, like by state, allowing users that can access multiple cities in a state to view all the events they could potentialy attend. Unfortunately most of the state data in the json was unfilled so I wasn't able to implement that extra sorting feature. 
- To add some extra functionality for the user, I decided that sorting by price would also be helpful for them, which has been implemented. They can also go back to sorting by date as well.
